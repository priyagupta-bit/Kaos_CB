Intentional terrible sign-up page.

# 🌀 Confusion & Co.

**A Delightfully Terrible Sign-Up Experience**
*Built for the “404: Design Not Found” – Bad UI/UX Track*

---

## 🎀 Overview

Confusion & Co. is an intentionally cursed sign-up page that transforms a simple form into a chaotic, illogical, and weirdly entertaining user experience.
This project breaks every known UX principle on purpose — while still being technically functional.

* **Mandatory fields that change** every time you revisit them.
* **Progress bar that goes backward** the closer you get to finishing.

### 🔐 Password Chaos

### 🎉 Confusing Micro-interactions
